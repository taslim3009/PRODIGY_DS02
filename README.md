Task 2: Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset. Explore relationship between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
In this task, I would perform Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis by using a 1988 dataset of patient information from the Cleveland database, which can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository.
